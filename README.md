# Validation-Form
This project is a client-side validated contact form built for modern, reliable user input. It is fully contained within a single index.html file, making it simple to runâ€”just open the file in any browser.

The form is structured with HTML5 and styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly interface.

Its core functionality is driven by Vanilla JavaScript which handles robust client-side validation. This ensures all required fields (Name, Email, Message) are non-empty and verifies the email address uses a valid format via a regular expression.
